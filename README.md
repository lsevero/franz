# severo-http-connector

A easy HTTP<->Kafka connector with a complete config file and swagger generation.

![http kafka converter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsevero/severo-http-connector/master/http-kafka.jpeg)

## Usage

Download the `severo-http-connector-<VERSION>-standalone.jar` from the releases tab and run the jar with the config files with the command:

```bash
java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=<path-to>/log4j2.xml -Dconfig=<path-to>/config.edn -jar severo-http-connector-<VERSION>-standalone.jar
```
Check the config files in the `example-config` folder.

The kafka producer will insert a `http-response-id` field to the root of the input payload to be sent to kafka on the `send-topic`.
The HTTP connection will keep waiting for a message on the `listen-topic` with the `http-response-id` field, when we receive the message it will be returned to http.
The consumer optionally accepts a `http-status` which is the status code to be passed on the http response, if no http-status is given will be returned a 200.

## `config.edn`

Explained config.edn:

{;Default kafka configs

## Logging

This project is using Log4j2 to log, and accepts a log4j2 compatible config file.
Besides the logs inside SeveroHTTPConnector you can extract the logs inside the kafka and http library, although they are very verbose.
Check the `example-config/log4j2.xml` file for a example.
The logging config is optional, although is recommended to use.

## Building
